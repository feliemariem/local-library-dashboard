# Reflections Log

This log is a personal space where I jot down daily insights and experiences from working on the Local Library Dashboard project. Each entry follows a simple structure to capture my progress, challenges, learnings, and next steps, providing a clear snapshot of my journey. I use the format `YYYY-MM-DD` for each entry to maintain chronological order and clarity.

Feel free to dive into my reflections to see how this project evolves over time and the lessons learned along the way.
